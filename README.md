# al-folio

**A simple, clean, and responsive [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) theme for academics.**

This site is built on [al-folio](https://alshedivat.github.io/al-folio/). See the [original repository](https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio) for full documentation.

## Installing

For installation details please refer to [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md).

## Features

### Light/Dark Mode

This template has a built-in light/dark mode. It detects the user preferred color scheme and automatically switches to it. You can also manually switch between light and dark mode by clicking on the sun/moon icon in the top right corner of the page.

### Publications

Your publications' page is generated automatically from your BibTex bibliography. Simply edit [\_bibliography/papers.bib](_bibliography/papers.bib). You can also add new `*.bib` files and customize the look of your publications however you like by editing [\_pages/publications.md](_pages/publications.md). By default, the publications will be sorted by year and the most recent will be displayed first. You can change this behavior and more in the `Jekyll Scholar` section in [\_config.yml](_config.yml) file.

You can add extra information to a publication, like a PDF file in the [assets/pdf/](assets/pdf/) directory and add the path to the PDF file in the BibTeX entry with the `pdf` field. Some of the supported fields are: `abstract`, `altmetric`, `arxiv`, `bibtex_show`, `blog`, `code`, `dimensions`, `doi`, `eprint`, `html`, `isbn`, `pdf`, `pmid`, `poster`, `slides`, `supp`, `video`, and `website`.

### Theming

A variety of beautiful theme colors have been selected for you to choose from. The default is purple, but you can quickly change it by editing the `--global-theme-color` variable in the `_sass/_themes.scss` file. Other color variables are listed there as well. The stock theme color options available can be found at [\_sass/\_variables.scss](_sass/_variables.scss). You can also add your own colors to this file assigning each a name for ease of use across the template.

### Social media previews

**al-folio** supports preview images on social media. To enable this functionality you will need to set `serve_og_meta` to `true` in your [\_config.yml](_config.yml). Once you have done so, all your site's pages will include Open Graph data in the HTML head element.

You will then need to configure what image to display in your site's social media previews. This can be configured on a per-page basis, by setting the `og_image` page variable. If for an individual page this variable is not set, then the theme will fall back to a site-wide `og_image` variable, configurable in your [\_config.yml](_config.yml). In both the page-specific and site-wide cases, the `og_image` variable needs to hold the URL for the image you wish to display in social media previews.

### Code quality checks

Currently, we run some checks to ensure that the code quality and generated site are good. The checks are done using GitHub Actions and the following tools:

- [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) - check if the formatting of the code follows the style guide
- [lychee](https://lychee.cli.rs/) - check for broken links
- [Axe](https://github.com/dequelabs/axe-core) (need to run manually) - do some accessibility testing

## License

The theme is available as open source under the terms of the [MIT License](https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio/blob/master/LICENSE).

Originally, **al-folio** was based on the [\*folio theme](https://github.com/bogoli/-folio) (published by [Lia Bogoev](https://liabogoev.com) and under the MIT license). Since then, it got a full re-write of the styles and many additional cool features.
