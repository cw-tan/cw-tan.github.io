I'm a second year PhD student in the [Materials Intelligence Research](https://mir.g.harvard.edu/) (MIR) group of Harvard Unviersity, where I am fortunate to be advised by [Boris Kozinsky](https://mir.g.harvard.edu/people/boris-kozinsky). My research interests lie at the intersection of atomistic materials modelling, electronic structure and artificial intelligence.

Prior to joining the MIR group, I was a senior research assistant in the [Sustainable Nanodevice Design Lab](https://www.nanodevice.group/home) of [Yee Sin Ang](https://smt.sutd.edu.sg/people/faculty/ang-yee-sin/) at the Singapore University of Technology and Design, where I developed a sustainability-guided _in silico_ materials screening framework and applied it to the search of ultrawide bandgap 2D material candidates for next-generation nanodevices.

I completed my BA in Physics and MPhil in Materials Science at the University of Cambridge. During my time at the [Materials Theory Group](https://www.mtg.msm.cam.ac.uk/) of Cambridge, I developed a differentiable software for orbital-free density functional simulations called [PROFESS-AD](https://profess-ad.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) under the supervision of [Chuck Witt](https://www.mtg.msm.cam.ac.uk/People/dr-w-chuck-witt) and [Chris Pickard](https://www.msm.cam.ac.uk/people/pickard).
